# The Monster Slayer

[LIVE](https://felipevfa.github.io/vue-monster-slayer/)

The Monster Slayer is a simple Vue application that lets you battle against a monster. 

Each turn, the player takes a simple action against the monster: attacking it normaly, unleashing a special attack against it or healing against damage.

The monster will then attack the player! Be careful, for some attacks can critically strike you for double the damage.

This app was written as part of the [VueJS 2 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide) course at Udemy. 

Currently, the app is not mobile-friendly, but its responsiveness will be adjusted soon.
